# Creation Kit Fixes

Last updated on Nexus: September 2021.

## Why?

Features ...

- Save ESM files.
- Edit plugins with ESP masters without those masters being removed.
- Navmesh psuedo-deletion option to remove triangles without actually deleting/modifying the mesh. (Idea by ElminsterAU)
- Generate LIP files (lip sync).
- Option to globally disable assert message boxes.
- Option to skip topic info validation.
- Option to disable automatic facegen on save.

Fixes ...

- Load plugins faster.
- Replace the CK's default memory allocator.
- Fix a resource leak that causes dialogs to stop opening.

## Version

REQUIRES: SSE CK version 1.5.3.0 or 1.5.73.0.
